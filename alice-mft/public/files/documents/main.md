## Introduction
*ALICE MFT Dashboard* is a project powered by the [CERN](https://home.cern/). It has been created to assist scientists on the [ALICE](https://home.cern/fr/science/alice) experiment. It aims to list, index, and optimally display information about the detector components.

The purpose of this document is to help the users to understand how does the website works, in order to facilitate the edition of content.

Here is some informations about the project:
- Starting: July, 2020
- Version: 2.0.0
- Repository: [https://github.com/alice-mft/website](https://github.com/alice-mft/website)

## Languages
Like the most part of the websites today, this project is using the following languages :
- [**HTML**](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/HTML), also known as *Hypertext Markup Language* is responsible of the website structure and contents.
- [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS), also known as *Cascading Style Sheets* is essential for the website design (fonts, colors, placement of elements, etc...)
- [**PHP**](https://www.php.net/), also known as *Hypertext Preprocessor* is in charge of the dynamism of the web site. It allows to have dynamic contents (which can change according a lot of factors) on a page.
- [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript) which brings a lot of animations perspectives to hide, or show dynamically some contents. Its particularity is to be executed on the client side, contrary to the above languages.

## Librairies
To acceed to more features of theses languages more easly, some developers created something named *"librairies"*. There could be used to have extra-features which could be used to improove and optimize some parts of each project. This project is using the following librairies:

- [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com/) which allows to facilitate the writing of javascript code and to make certain functionalities more accessible.
- [**jQueryUI**](https://jqueryui.com/) which allows you to add to jQuery a collection of visual effects for animations.
- [**Datatables**](https://datatables.net/) which allows you to dynamize an HTML table using javascript. The version we use has been adapted to better fit the needs of the project.
- [**LessCSS**](http://lesscss.org/) which allows to dynamically generate css and to optimize the writing syntax of the language.

## Framework (Laravel)
To structure a project in a more optimal way, it is possible to use something named *"framework"*. It is used to define the bases and the main lines of the application. This project is using laravel which is an open-source web framework written in PHP. It uses the model-view-controller (also known as MVC).

The framework is used by many sites today and is very convenient to use because it allows greater freedom on page management, while keeping a clean and optimized development structure.
